# **Andriod Malware Classifier**
Classifies google play store applications as safe or malicious. The data is imported from     Nuray Baltaci's paper; A Comparasion Of Classification Algorithms For Mobile     Malware Detection: Market Metadata as Input Source. The data set consists of permissions     requested by the application as well as metadata.
# **Problem**
Android dominates the smartphone ecosystem, with over an 80% market share and over 300 million units shipped every quarter. The sheer volume of devices, when combined with the open and free nature of the Play Store, results in a significant number of malicious apps being downloaded to devices from the Play Store. One feasible method of detecting and eradicating malicious apps is machine learning-based classification. This applicaation uses application permissions as well as Google Play Store data to identify malicious applications
# **Dataset**
- 17,000 Google applications with over 800 features each
- Features include Andriod application permissions ex. Request access to camera
- Features include Play Store meta data ex. Date Published
- Features have been converted to binary and normalized
# **Run**
Run the PreProcess.py file that will prepare the data and create the classificaiton labels using existing malware detction software and thresholds. After run the NeuralNetwork.py to build/train model and output it's accuracy as well as a TensorBoard summary
